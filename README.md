# IT Security Project – Warmaksan Risk Management and Protection Plan

## Overview

This project presents a full security assessment and protection strategy for Warmaksan, a hypothetical organization. It identifies critical assets, evaluates potential threats, outlines risk levels, recommends security controls, and aligns security strategies with standards like ISO 31000 and GDPR. The report also proposes policies and stakeholder roles to build a strong IT security foundation.

## Objectives

- Assess the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of key assets
- Identify and prioritize system vulnerabilities and threats
- Recommend technical, physical, and administrative security controls
- Align Warmaksan policies with IT security requirements
- Implement risk assessment and auditing methodologies (e.g., ISO 31000)
- Enhance compliance with GDPR and related regulations

## Project Sections

### Asset Evaluation (Part A)
- Hardware: Servers, storage devices, networking hardware
- Software: OS, applications, security and backup tools
- Data: Customer data and disk storage
- Network: VPN, subnets, internet connection
- Risk areas analyzed using CIA principles

### Risk Assessment (Part B)
- Threats categorized by likelihood (e.g., possible, almost certain)
- Consequences measured (e.g., minor, major, doomsday)
- Top priorities include servers, customer information, and the data center
- Level of risk determined for each asset and vulnerability

### Recommended Controls (Part C)
- Technical controls: Firewalls, encryption, VPNs, multi-factor authentication
- Physical security: CCTV, biometric access, environmental controls
- Administrative controls: Access policies, password policies, audit procedures

### Security Strategy (Part D)
- Alignment of IT and business security goals
- Regulatory compliance through GDPR, encryption, access control, and retention policies
- IT security audit implementation and impact
- Data recovery, monitoring, and incident response planning

### Risk Management (Part E, F)
- ISO 31000 methodology applied
- Risk identification, impact analysis, and mitigation
- Regular reviews and updates based on business needs

### Policy Review (Part H–J)
Detailed policies created for:
- Data backup
- Remote access
- VPN and firewall configuration
- Third-party access
- GDPR compliance
- Password and clean desk practices

### Stakeholder Roles (Part K)
Defined responsibilities for:
- Management
- IT and security officers
- HR and legal departments
- Third-party vendors
- End users and auditors

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of CIA triad in asset management
- Application of security frameworks (ISO 31000, GDPR)
